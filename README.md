Title: THRIVE AGRO is a web app centered to improve farmers' conditions through our dynamic features like 
Inventory management: Farmers can manage their inventory by adding product quantity, expiration date, and product price which would give them an idea of how much stock is present.Farmers can track seeds , fertilizers and monitoring equipment .

Buyer contacts-We connect farmers with mill owners who directly purchase from farmers avoiding any need for middlemen which decreases transportation costs and commission taken by middlemen.

Reporting section- Farmers can report to govt about any infrastructure problem they are facing like poor roads, bad irrigation facilities, dam construction, etc so that on an open platform their issues are resolved.
